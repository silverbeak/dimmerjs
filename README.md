# dimmerjs
A simple CLI application that helps you keep your docker images in check

## Usage

Just run `node index.js` in the folder to start the application. I've tried it on my mac, and it should work on Linux too, although you probably have to be root to use it.

## Simple, truly simple

I've never tried to do a Node CLI before, and wanted to give it a go. I have a ton of docker images on my computer, and it's eating my space. I don't have a good tool for removing them, so I thought I'd create one. I'm sure there are better tools out there, but it's fun to scratch your own itch sometimes, and that's what I did here.

## Development

Just clone it and hack away! Feel free to make changes and send in PR:s if you like, and share fun!
